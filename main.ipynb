famous institutions such as humbold University Berlin leading the way in research and Innovation you are sure to receive an excellent standard of learning whether you're taking up a course on engineering or literature two drinkable tap water living in Germany certainly comes with a lot of perks from the delicious sausages to the breathtaking cities but one perk that doesn't often get mentioned is how drinkable tap water in Germany is it's true and it's really quite remarkable of course not all German towns have perfect tap water but by far most do in fact many Germans believe their drinking water is so good because it's monitored more stringently than other countries and for sure there are no worries about added chemicals or nasty tastes what could be better three unemployment benefits if find themselves out of work due to whatever reason don't fret your well-being is taken care of thanks to the German government's generous Provisions for unemployment insurance unemployment insurance offers more than just monthly benefits to help you find job for instance recipients can utilize up to 50% of their benefit to continue their education or training at an accredited Institute making them more marketable for future work this feature makes Germany's system truly unique amongst its counterparts across Europe four Germans are very punctual ah the Germans and their punctuality it's one of the foundations of life in Germany it doesn't matter if you're running late to a meeting eating dinner with friends or just taking the bus if you live in Germany and don't arrive on time be prepared to get some judging looks for those unfamiliar with German culture schedules and arrival times can seem like an implicit expectation people may start mentally counting down 5 minutes before your planned arrival time but being fashionably late is not accepted here the pros of living around punctual people first off no more waiting for late friends you'll see someone at 6:00 p.m. if they claim they'll be there the 5 minute delay phone calls are over five very livable if you're looking for a fantastic country to live Germany should be your first choice Germany has exceptional quality of life and some of the world's most beautiful cities and towns to begin life in Germany is safe Germany's low crime rate is due to its tight regulations and extensive security measures Germany's cultural offerings and safety make it livable from concerts and festivals like October Fest to wonderful galleries like alter naal Gallery Berlin you can explore fantastic new experiences and learn about European art and culture six efficient public transport Germany has very efficient public transport systems that's right no more worrying about finding a parking spot no more car payments and insurance costs instead you get to hop on a bus or train and take advantage of free Wi-Fi while you travel what's even better is that most cities offer discounts for students or those with limited incomes so everyone has access to Affordable transport options plus when it comes to safety there are cameras on all trains and buses throughout the country making sure that your journey is secure seven Germans are fairly honest and reliable living in Germany can be an absolute dream come true especially if you value honesty and reliability Germans have a well-deserved reputation for being fairly honest and reliable you get what you pay for this is one of the major pros of living here not only do people usually keep their word but they don't beat around the bush either when discussing something important or giving feedback that means that no matter who it comes from even your boss at work you can rest assured that what is said will not be sugarcoated it'll be straightforward and to the point cons one bureaucracy Germans think of beer gardens and sausages not paperwork unfortunately bureaucracy is an unavoidable aspect of life here from registering at the alander beura Foreigner's office to getting health insurance or a bank account expect a sea of forms remember to gather Department stamps and signatures along the Route navigating this bureaucratic maze can feel like every institution has its own rules making it harder for an outsider two difficulty in making friends one of the major cons is making friends yes it can be quite difficult to make friends in this culturally diverse country if you don't speak the same language or understand its Customs it is one of the major negative sides of living in Germany but don't be alarmed Germans do actually have their own way of connecting with others through beer gardens now before you go thinking that all German socializing centers around drinking beer let me clarify there are other activities too like playing cards and board games or just chatting away over dinner you may even find yourself jumping on trampolines at an outdoor party with your new found Buddies three bad customer service when living in Germany you're likely to come across some seriously bad customer service it can range from basic rudess all the way up to downright hostile behavior from staff at various establishments and companies here you might be wondering why this is well the Germans have their own unique culture when it comes to customer relations that doesn't always align with our expectations as customers outside Germany let me give you an example let's say you are out shopping and spot something that catches your eye so naturally you approach a shop assistant for help only to get hit with a very brusk response or even worse they just ignore you altogether this often happens because they expect customers to shop independently rather than actively seeking out assistance this is one of the most ignored negative sides of living in Germany four bad internet connection it's no surprised that moving to Germany has its advantages from their amazing culture and delicious food to the gorgeous view news but one thing that many people Overlook is how bad the internet connection can be here that's right folks you heard it here first living in Germany comes with a terrible internet connection it is one of the most annoying negative sides of living in Germany sure some areas of the country have better connections than others but on average Germans are stuck with slow speeds and high prices when it comes to their internet service providers or isps from dropped connections to painfully slow loading times let us tell you it's enough to make any techsavvy person throw their computer out the window five no air conditioning not everything is perfect here especially when it comes to air conditioning while other countries are cranking down their temperatures with powerful AC units Germany has been left a bit behind on this front which can make summer days quite uncomfortable no matter how hot it gets outside Germans just seem content with keeping their windows open and relying on fans or luck to stay cool indoors this means that if you're ever visiting or living in Germany during the summer months then you prepare yourself for some sweat filled days ahead luckily though there's usually a nice breeze coming through those open Windows sort of like Nature's Own built-in air conditioner six tough language if you thought learning a foreign language was hard think again if you've ever wanted to test your linguistic metal look no further than Germany from casual conversation to mastering the finer points of grammar and verb conjugation learning German can be quite the challenge this might be one of those negative sides of living in Germany that you can overcome as you live there and learn the language sure moving to Germany has its perks but one big con is that speaking the native tongue can sometimes feel like a Herculean task the sheer amount of vocabulary and complex sentence structure especially compared to English can make some expats feel intimidated or overwhelmed especially if they're starting from scratch or brushing up on their skills after years away from the classroom we have tried our best to discuss all the pros and cons of living in Germany in this video living in this diverse and Lively country offers great job prospects great infrastructure and a great quality of life however like any move to a new home in a new country there are downsides such as slow internet bureaucracy and missing your favorite comfort Foods before moving to Germany weigh all these perks and downsides thank you for watching this video please don't forget to comment
